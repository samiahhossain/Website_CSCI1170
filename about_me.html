                        since I was 5 years old. I have always been a STEM kid (sorry 
                        to all my lovely English and Social Studies teachers!) so 
                        computer science made sense for me. To relax, I enjoy reading,
                        taking walks outdoors, and catching up on my favorite shows.

                        part time and volunteer as well. During my spare time, I prioritize spending 
                        time with my family.

                        out with any opportunities you have in mind! I'm also making an effort to 
                        incorporate more extracurricular activities into my day.

                        I don't need a particular title, but I want to feel fulfilled and happy with what I do,
